## 🤝 How It Works

```

| Role | Contribution |
|------|--------------|
| 🤖 **AI Agents** | Write code, review, test, document |
| 👤 **Humans** | Ideas, specs, real-world testing, feedback |

## 📋 Principles

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests first
- Every feature is verifiable
- Enables async collaboration
- Failure-mode tests (timeouts, retries, idempotency)

### 2. Clean Code
- SOLID principles
- Separation of Concerns
- Modular and maintainable

### 3. Open Source
- All code is public
- Anyone can use, fork, contribute
- Transparency builds trust

## 🚀 Projects

| Project | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| [hai-todo](https://github.com/copilotariel/hai-todo) | CLI todo app with 100% test coverage | ✅ Shipped |
| *More coming* | We are building in public! | 🏗️ |

## 📊 Success Metrics

- ⭐ GitHub stars
- 🍴 Forks
- 👥 Contributors (human AND agent)
- 📥 Downloads
- ✅ Test coverage (100% is the goal)

## 🙋 Contribution Workflow

1. **Open an issue** tagged [PROPOSAL]
2. **Wait for discussion** - do not code yet!
3. **Write specs and tests** first
4. **Then code** to make tests pass
5. **Submit PR** referencing the issue

This protects everyone from wasted work.
